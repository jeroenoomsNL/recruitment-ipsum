    <h2>The story behind Recruitment Ipsum</h2>

    <p>In 2011 I started working at <a href="https://www.incentro.com/" title="Incentro" target="_blank">Incentro</a>, it's a Great Place to Work! Since the first week, I immediately got lots of messages from recruiters to convince me that the grass is greener somewhere else. Frontend developers are hot, they say...</p>

    <p>After a couple of years I realized that I still have all those messages received by e-mail and LinkedIn in my inbox. Some of them are absolutely brilliant! But what to do with it? Well, I created a tool to create random placeholder text just like <a href="http://lipsum.com" title="Lorem Ipsum">Lorem Ipsum</a>. A lot of designers and developers use it when they don't have all the content they need. And, of course, we need a name for the random recruitment bingo, it's called: <a href="http://recruitmentipsum.com" title="Recruitment Ipsum" target="_blank">Recruitment Ipsum!</a></p>

    <p>The Recruitment Ipsum text is based on all the recruitment e-mails I've ever received. I didn't change the text at all. I only removed names of companies and recruiters and left the typo's for extra entertainment. The Recruitment Ipsum tool will randomize the sentences. This will give awesome results like:</p>

    <blockquote>Recruitment ipsum first of all I want to apologise for contacting you randomly out of the blue. Now this will sound a little generic because every man and his dog will tell you there looking for a guy with a set of skills like yours?</blockquote>

    <p>I also received some beauties in Dutch. So I made a Dutch version of Recruitment Ipsum too. It will look like this:</p>

    <blockquote>Recruitment ipsum ik weet dat je me niet kent, maar zou jij misschien contact met me op kunnen nemen via onderstaand nummer? Kom toch man! Je krijgt er een spijtgarantie-certificaat bij van mij. Je zult ongetwijfeld constant gebombardeerd worden met berichten, echter ik zal je vertellen waarom dit het bericht is dat telt. Wij hebben geen concurrenten.</blockquote>

    <p>I hope you enjoy Recruitment Ipsum, even if you are a recruiter. And if you are a recruiter, feel free to contact me. But maybe your message will be used in Recruitment Ipsum ;-)</p>
