    <h2>The story behind Recruitment Ipsum</h2>

    <p>
      In 2011 I started working at a consultancy company as a Front-end
      Developer. Since the first week, I immediately got lots of messages from
      recruiters to convince me that the grass is greener somewhere else.
      Frontend developers are hot, they say...
    </p>

    <p>
      After a couple of years I realized that I still have all those messages
      received by e-mail and LinkedIn in my inbox. Some of them are absolutely
      brilliant! But what to do with it? Well, I created a tool to create random
      placeholder text just like
      <a href="http://lipsum.com" title="Lorem Ipsum">Lorem Ipsum</a>. A lot of
      designers and developers use it when they don't have all the content they
      need. And, of course, we need a name for the random recruitment bingo,
      it's called:
      <a
        href="http://recruitmentipsum.com"
        title="Recruitment Ipsum"
        target="_blank"
        >Recruitment Ipsum!</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      The Recruitment Ipsum text is based on all the recruitment e-mails I've
      ever received. I didn't change the text at all. I only removed names of
      companies and recruiters and left the typo's for extra entertainment. The
      Recruitment Ipsum tool will randomize the sentences. This will give
      awesome results like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Recruitment ipsum first of all I want to apologise for contacting you
      randomly out of the blue. Now this will sound a little generic because
      every man and his dog will tell you there looking for a guy with a set of
      skills like yours?
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      I also received some beauties in Dutch. So I made a Dutch version of
      Recruitment Ipsum too. It will look like this:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Recruitment ipsum ik weet dat je me niet kent, maar zou jij misschien
      contact met me op kunnen nemen via onderstaand nummer? Kom toch man! Je
      krijgt er een spijtgarantie-certificaat bij van mij. Je zult ongetwijfeld
      constant gebombardeerd worden met berichten, echter ik zal je vertellen
      waarom dit het bericht is dat telt. Wij hebben geen concurrenten.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      I hope you enjoy Recruitment Ipsum, even if you are a recruiter. And if
      you are a recruiter, feel free to contact me. But maybe your message will
      be used in Recruitment Ipsum ;-)
