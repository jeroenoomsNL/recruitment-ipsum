      "Op basis hiervan kijk ik graag in mijn portfolio naar passend opties.",
      "Om het echt anders te doen en passend in de lijn van mijn nieuwe bedrijf maak ik geen gebruik van recruiters en werving-en selectiebureaus.",
      "Zij gaan mij geen kandidaten leveren die dan eventueel na hun beoordeling bij mogen solliciteren.",
      "Nee, ik geloof in het rechtstreekse contact, van begin af aan met elkaar in contact zijn.",
      "Direct gevoel bij elkaar krijgen zonder ruis op de lijn.",
      "Daarom solliciteer ik nu graag eens bij jou en wel naar de functie van werkgever.",
      "Natuurlijk begrijp ik dat we dan nog wel een gesprek moeten voeren waarin ik jou moet overtuigen dat dit mooie bedrijf waar aan jij mede vorm mag gaan geven, nu de ideale werkgever voor jou is, maar die uitdaging ga ik graag aan.",
      "Mocht dit positief uitpakken voor ons beiden dan betaal ik je met plezier elke maand een uitstekend salaris uit.",
      "Gezien de startfase van het bedrijf moeten we het over de secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden nog hebben, die zijn ter invulling maar daar komen we vast ook wel uit!",
