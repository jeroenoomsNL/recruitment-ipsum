## Contribute to Recruitment Ipsum

I've created this project just for fun so I don't have a real roadmap for this project at the moment. Feel free to do a pull request if you have anything fun to add!

You can always help me with providing real recruitment messages, even in other languages!

```bash
# install vue cli
yarn global add @vue/cli

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn serve

# build for production with minification
yarn build

# deploy to github pages (repo admins only)
yarn deploy
```
